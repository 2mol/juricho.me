ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Juri. I'm a software developer currently working on financial infrastructure in (parts of) Africa at [Wave Mobile Money](https://www.wave.com/).

In my personal time I'm pretty into woodworking and climbing.


## Projects

I like to work on physical and digital things. Here are some that have reached at least a minimum notion of finished or polished.

[**Laser-cut jigsaw puzzles**](/posts/puzzle-generator) - I wrote a puzzle generator so that I could generate SVGs to cut out with an industrial Laser.

[**ZÃ¼ri DÃ«sch**](/zurich-table) - A minimalist couch table that has a second use as a bench.

[**Gulliver**](https://gllvr.com) - a trip planner with a focus on simplicity and a slick user interface.

[**Paperboy**](https://github.com/2mol/pboy) - a tiny commandline utility to help with your pdf hoarding.

[**Divorce rate calculator**](https://2mol.gitlab.io/urechner) - Prototype tool for calculating divorce outcomes under Swiss law. Built to expose complex rules via a simple UI, and to provide legal documentation to each of the inputs. I re-learned the lesson that [your biggest competitor is a spreadsheet](https://grid.is/blog/your-biggest-competitor-is-a-spreadsheet).

A long time ago I studied math and wrote a Master's thesis in number theory on hyperelliptic curves ([pdf here](/files/masterarbeit-hyperelliptic_curves-juri.pdf)) under the great [David Masser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Masser). Check it out, it has imagesm and I even managed to prove something new! I'm still proud of it, although I can't claim to still understand my own proofs.
