## projects

Lately my interests revolve around good design, minimalist UIs, and making complex workflows easy and intuitive.

I believe that the latter should be the ultimate goal of all software: empower the user so that they can delegate the boring stuff to the machine and focus on the higher-level meaningful problems instead.

Here is some of what I've built in the past:

- **gulliver** - a trip planner with a focus on simplicity and a slick user interface.

- **paperboy** - a tiny commandline utility to help with your pdf hoarding.
<br/>→ [github](https://github.com/2mol/pboy)
- **a divorce rate calculator** - built as a prototype to show how a custom, reactive user interface can bring clarity into complex legal rules. The tool also provides legal documentation to each of the key inputs, enabling lawyers and judges to be many times more efficient and consistent when handling a case.
<br/>(In German, and only applicable to Swiss law.)

## woodworking

I like making furniture. This is where I will gradually put plans, photos, and build instructions of the more interesting projects.
