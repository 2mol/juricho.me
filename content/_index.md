Hi, I'm Juri ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer, currently employed as a full-stack engineer at [Valora Digital](https://valora.digital/). I work on autonomous stores and on making critical systems beautiful and reliable.

I enjoy typed functional programming. I write F# at my day-job, and I co-organise [ZuriHac](http://zurihac.com/), a European Haskell Hackathon. I tend to reach for Elm for doing frontend work.

When I'm not earning money, I also like to make furniture, go climbing, cooking, and all that other clichÃ© stuff.

You can contact me via [email](mailto:juri@juricho.me), or by messaging me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/jurichome).


## Projects

I like to work on physical and digital projects. Here are some that have reached at least a minimum notion of finished or polished.

[**Laser-cut jigsaw puzzles**](/posts/puzzle-generator) - I wrote a puzzle generator so that I could generate SVGs to cut out with an industrial Laser.

[**ZÃ¼ri DÃ«sch**](/zurich-table) - A minimalist couch table that has a second use as a bench.

[**Gulliver**](https://gllvr.com) - a trip planner with a focus on simplicity and a slick user interface.

[**Paperboy**](https://github.com/2mol/pboy) - a tiny commandline utility to help with your pdf hoarding.

[**Divorce rate calculator**](https://2mol.gitlab.io/urechner) - This encodes Swiss law about separating estates and calculating child support. Built as a prototype, learning the hard way that [your biggest competitor is a spreadsheet](https://grid.is/blog/your-biggest-competitor-is-a-spreadsheet). The key idea was to expose complex rules via a simple UI, and to provide legal documentation to each of the inputs.
