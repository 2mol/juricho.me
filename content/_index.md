Hi, I'm Juri ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer, currently working on mobile payments in Africa at [Wave](https://www.wave.com/).

<!-- I enjoy typed functional programming. I write F# at my day-job, and I co-organise [ZuriHac](http://zurihac.com/), a European Haskell Hackathon. I tend to reach for Elm for doing frontend work.

Apart from coding, I love working on infrastructure. I've done almost anything on that spectrum: The 3 big cloud providers, CI/CD, containerised services, infrastructure-as-code, DevOps, architecting new systems, big data platforms, and even security.

A long time ago I studied pure math and ended up writing a master's thesis on [hyperelliptic curves](/files/masterarbeit-hyperelliptic_curves-juri.pdf) under a [delightfully excellent supervisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Masser). I managed to prove something new, and it even has illustrations! I'm still proud of it, although I can't claim to still understand my own proofs.

In my personal time I like to do woodworking, go climbing, and start too many projects. -->

You can contact me via [email](mailto:juri@juricho.me).


## Projects

I like to work on physical and digital things. Here are some that have reached at least a minimum notion of finished or polished.

[**Laser-cut jigsaw puzzles**](/posts/puzzle-generator) - I wrote a puzzle generator so that I could generate SVGs to cut out with an industrial Laser.

[**ZÃ¼ri DÃ«sch**](/zurich-table) - A minimalist couch table that has a second use as a bench.

[**Gulliver**](https://gllvr.com) - a trip planner with a focus on simplicity and a slick user interface.

[**Paperboy**](https://github.com/2mol/pboy) - a tiny commandline utility to help with your pdf hoarding.

[**Divorce rate calculator**](https://2mol.gitlab.io/urechner) - Prototype tool for calculating divorce outcomes under Swiss law. Built to expose complex rules via a simple UI, and to provide legal documentation to each of the inputs. I re-learned the lesson that [your biggest competitor is a spreadsheet](https://grid.is/blog/your-biggest-competitor-is-a-spreadsheet).
