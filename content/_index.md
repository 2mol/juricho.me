Hi there!

I'm Juri, I like to make things, so here are some of them. Currently I'm enjoying playing with [data](https://d-one.ai), woodworking, and making webapps.

## projects and experiments

Here are some thing's I've made in the past:

- [gulliver](https://gllvr.com) - a work in progress travel planner with a focus on simplicity.
- [paperboy](https://github.com/2mol/pboy), which is a commandline utility to help with your pdf hoarding.
- a [divorce rate calculator](https://2mol.gitlab.io/urechner/), built as a prototype to show how complex legal rules can be translated into a tool with a clear user interface. It's in German, and only applicable to Swiss law, so don't go around using it for anything serious. Also, don't get divorced, turns out it's really expensive and messy.
