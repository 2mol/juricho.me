Hi, I'm Juri!

I'm a developer, gainfully employed as a full-stack engineer at [Valora Digital](https://valora.digital/). I work on autonomous stores and making critical systems beautiful and reliable.

I'm interested in . I have a deep nagging feeling that we _still_ haven't scratched the surface of what human-computer interaction could be. We can do amazing that

I started to collect [interesting problems](/problems) that are probably within reach of a motivated programmer with a couple of weekends to spare.



Currently that means webapps, but I bla physical interactions with computers.

I enjoy typed functional programming. I write F# at my current day-job, and I co-organize the largest European Haskell Hackathon: [ZuriHac](http://zurihac.com/). I tend to reach for Elm for doing frontend work.

When I'm not coding, I like making furniture, climbing, cooking, and all that other cliché stuff.

You can contact me via email above, or by messaging me on twitter.


## Projects

Sometimes start physical or digital projects. Here some of them.

**Züri Dësch** - A minimalist [couch table](/zurich-table) that has a second use as a bench. Go ahead, build a replica.

**Gulliver** - a trip planner with a focus on simplicity and a slick user interface.

**Paperboy** - a tiny commandline utility to help with your pdf hoarding.
<br/>→ [github.com/2mol/pboy](https://github.com/2mol/pboy)

**Divorce rate calculator** - This encodes Swiss law about separating estates and calculating child support. Built as a prototype, learning the hard way that [your biggest competitor is a spreadsheet](https://grid.is/blog/your-biggest-competitor-is-a-spreadsheet). The key idea was to expose complex rules via a simple UI, and to provide legal documentation to each of the inputs.
