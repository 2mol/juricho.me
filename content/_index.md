Hi, I'm Juri. I like to make things, so here are some of them. Currently I enjoy [working with data](https://d-one.ai), [woodworking](#woodworking), and making webapps.

Lately my interests revolve around good design, minimalist UIs, and making complex workflows easy and intuitive. I've experienced time and time again that we can still unlock huge productivity gains with better UX.

I believe that if there is any point to software, it's to augment human capabilities and provide new tools for thinking. See [intresting problems](#problems) below for some examples.

You can contact me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/jurichome), or by sending an email to [juri@juricho.me](mailto:juri@juricho.me).

## projects

Here is some of what I've built in the past:

- **gulliver** - a trip planner with a focus on simplicity and a slick user interface.

- **paperboy** - a tiny commandline utility to help with your pdf hoarding.
<br/>→ [github](https://github.com/2mol/pboy)
- **a divorce rate calculator** - built as a prototype to show how a custom, reactive user interface can bring clarity into complex legal rules. The tool also provides legal documentation to each of the key inputs, enabling lawyers and judges to be many times more efficient and consistent when handling a case.

## interesting problems {#problems}

Below is a list of problems for which I'm not aware of an existing solution. One or the other might be pretty easy to implement, and I plan to give them a go when I have the time.

Reach out if you have any thoughts ideas, or if there are existing tools/products that I have overlooked.


### teaching via git diff history

Despite it's unquestionable success, I believe that version control is _still_ not used to its full potential.

When I read a tutorial, blog post, or documentation, I often would like to see the **diff of the code** at each step.

Currently the presenter has to



It would be fun to try the same thing for teaching writing or other text-based topics.


### SQL in your text editor

I want an editor plugin (particularily [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) that lets me write **SQL queries against files with tabular data** (mostly csv, parquet, etc).

I want to see the resulting data right there in the editor. I know of [Rainbow CSV](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mechatroner.rainbow-csv), but I think the experience can be improved. The query engine is awkward, and I have to address the columns by index instead of by name.

The approach I would like to try is to dump the data into sqlite and do some simple detection of column types. Then simply send the query to sqlite and make the output pretty.


## woodworking

I like making furniture. This is where I will gradually put plans, and photos of the more interesting projects.
