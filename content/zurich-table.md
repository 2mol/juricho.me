Let me introduce you to a **couch table** so simple, that I feel I didn't create the design so much as to _discover_ it.

It started out as an obsessive conviction that I could make a fully stable couch table that didn't need an [apron](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=table+apron) for rigidity.

To add to the challenge, I wanted to use it as a **bench** when needed, and the first version was built to support the weight of 3 people. It worked great, so I later built two shorter versions that could seat two and had slimmer tops that the first one.

Since a couple of friends have already asked me for the plans with the intention of building their own, I'm posting a summary of the design and the build.


Since I get to name it, I'm calling it the **Züri Dësch**, after the city where it was conceived, and the Luxembourgish word for table.


## the plan

The design should fulfill the following criteria:

- have only five parts.
- be sturdy enough to carry the weight of people sitting on it.
- possible to build with semi-basic tools in a small space.
- be fast and simple[^1] to make.
- look good.

It's not the _absolute easiest_ build, since it has these long dovetails attaching the legs to the top. It also helps to have a decent workbench+vice to hold the pieces at various steps.

However, I think anybody with some experience, diligence, and tools should be able to do it. For reference, [this beautiful mess](/img/zurich-table/bedroom-workshop2.jpg) was my bedroom workshop in which I built all three tables.

## how to make your own

### what you need

- a couple of boards of wood. I've tried ash and oak.
- a way to flatten[^3] and join boards to make the top.
- one or two wide woodworking chisels.
- a saw - I recommend a circular saw, or a japanese handsaw if you're confident you can make a straight angled cut with it. The latter are quite affordable, and *amazing*.
- something to measure and draw angles with (like a sliding T bevel + protractor).
- sandpaper or a power sander.
- a pencil.


### optional

- a card scraper for surface finish.
- a handplane to thin the legs, chamfer edges and flatten the top of the legs sticking out.

[^1]: Fast and minimal materials also means that it can be _affordable_. I care about long-lasting objects being accessible to as many people as possible.
<p>
I've seen (admittedly cool) benches being sold for 2000 bucks[^2] where I live. What.
</p><p>
I estimated that I could churn out a dozen Züri tables in 3 days with a bit of prep, meaning they could be profitably sold for a fraction of that.

[^2]: Euros, US Dollars, Swiss Francs, pretty much the same at the time of writing.
