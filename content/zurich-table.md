Let me introduce you to a couch table _so simple_, that I feel I didn't create the design so much as _discover_ it.

It started out as an obsessive conviction that it was possible to make a very stable, minimalist couch table that didn't need an [apron](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=table+apron) for rigidity.

To add to the challenge, I wanted to use it as a bench when needed, and the first version was built to support the weight of 3 people. It worked great, so I later built two shorter versions that could seat two and had slimmer tops that the first one.

Since a couple of friends have already asked me for the plans with the intention of building their own, I'm posting a summary of the design and the build.


Since I get to name it, I'm calling it the **Züri Dësch**, after the city where it was conceived, and the Luxembourgish word for table.

Here are two specimens:

## the plan

The design should fulfill the following criteria:

- have only five parts.
- be sturdy enough to carry the weight of people sitting on it.
- possible to build with semi-basic tools in a small space.
- be fast and simple[^1] to make.
- look good.

Skill-wise it's easy, but not a not a _completely trivial_ build, mainly due to these long dovetails attaching the legs to the top.

However, I think anybody with some experience, diligence, and tools should be able to do it. For reference, [this beautiful mess](/img/zurich-table/bedroom-workshop2.jpg) was my bedroom workshop in which I made all three tables.

## how to make your own

What you'll need:

1. a couple of **boards** of the wood of your choice. I've tried ash and oak.
1. a way to **flatten**[^2] and **join** boards to make the top.
1. one or two wide woodworking **chisels**.
1. a **saw** - I recommend a circular saw. Alternatively a japanese handsaw if you're confident you can make a straight cut with it. The latter are quite affordable, and *amazing*.
1. something to measure and **draw angles** (like a sliding T bevel + protractor).
1. 2 **clamps**, as long as your table is wide.
1. **glue**.
1. **sandpaper** or a power sander.
1. **oil** to finish.
1. **pencil**, **tape**, a **square**, you know the drill


Optional:

- card scraper for surface finish.
- handplane to thin the legs, chamfer edges and flatten the top of the legs sticking out.
- small router to chamfer edges and remove material for the dovetail (haven't tried it).
- a jigsaw or a bandsaw to help cut the dovetails (haven't tried it).


## download plans

Here is a SketchUp file where I wrote down the measurements of one of the versions.

[^1]: Minimal materials and easy to build also means that it can be _affordable_. I care about long-lasting objects being accessible to more than just a wealthy few.
<br/><br/>
I've seen (admittedly excellent) benches being sold for 2000.- where I live. I estimate that you could churn out a dozen Züri tables in about 3 days with a bit of prep, meaning they could be profitably sold for a fraction of the above.


[^2]: I used a big planer in a community workshop.
