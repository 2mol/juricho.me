Let me introduce you to a **couch table** so simple and elegant, that I don't feel that it was designed, instead I feel like I _discovered_ it.

It started out as an obsessive conviction that I could make a fully stable couch table that didn't need an apron for rigidity.

To add to the challenge, I wanted to use it as a bench when needed, and the first version was built to support the weight of 3 people. It worked great, so I later built two shorter versions that could seat two and had slimmer tops that the first one.

Now that a couple of friends have asked me for the plans with the intention of building their own, I'm posting a summary of the design and the build.

Since I also get to name it, I'm calling it the **Züri Dësch**, after the Swiss city where it was conceived, and the Luxembourgish word for table.
