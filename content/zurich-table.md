Let me introduce you to a **couch table** so simple and elegant, that I don't feel that it was designed, instead I feel like I _discovered_ it.

It started out as an obsessive conviction that I could make a fully stable couch table that didn't need an [apron](https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/1638/how-can-i-design-a-large-cherry-table-with-no-aprons) for rigidity.

To add to the challenge, I wanted to use it as a bench when needed, and the first version was built to support the weight of 3 people. It worked great, so I later built two shorter versions that could seat two and had slimmer tops that the first one.

Now that a couple of friends have asked me for the plans with the intention of building their own, I'm posting a summary of the design and the build.

Since I get to name it, I'm calling it the **Züri Dësch**, after the city where it was conceived, and the Luxembourgish word for table.


## the plan

To summarise the criteria: This table should...

- be easy enough to build with semi-basic tools in a small space.
- be sturdy enough to carry the weight of people sitting on it.
- be fast and simple to build.
    - I think one could churn out a dozen in 3 days with a bit of preparation.
    - Fast also means that it can be _affordable_. I care about good handmade design & craft being accessible to more than just a wealthy subset of the population.
- look good.

It's not the _absolute easiest_ build, since it has these long dovetails attaching the legs to the top, and I suspect it needs a decent workbench to hold the pieces in place at various steps.

However, I think anybody with some experience, diligence, and tools should be able to do it. For reference, [this](/img/zurich-table/bedroom-workshop.jpg) was my bedroom workshop in which I build all three couch tables.
