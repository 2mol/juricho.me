My friends sooner or later get to find out about my unreasonable and undying love for [breakcore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakcore) (sometimes much to their dismay and confusion).

As far as genres go, it's immature, hyperactive, weird, totally grating, way too fast, and simply my absolute favourite thing ever.

Here are some of the best tracks:

## documentary

There is a half-hour documentary from 2006 called [Notes On Breakcore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40FJhPerCHo) which I find utterly adorable.

-> link to [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20131012061844/http://notes.breakcore.net/) if you can still manage to run flashplayer videos.
